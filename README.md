# my_first_repo
If I create an update_readme branch, as you can see in Figure 4-3, GitHub automati‐
cally checks out that new branch. You can see this, both on the branch button where
the current branch is displayed, and in the browser URL bar that ends with tree/
update_readme, signifying that we’re on the update_readme branch.
