Hello, my name is Alex Kimani Gachanja. 
I have a bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and biotechnology from the University of Embu where I graduated in 2017. 
Currently, I’m enrolled for a Master's course in Bioinformatics at Pwani University. 
I have a theoretical background in microbial genomics. 
My expectation from this Programming for Biologist unit is that at the end of this unit I will be able to write programs that will assist me to do complex genomic analysis to various genomic data that I will come into contact with in my career as a Bioinformatician. 
Thank you.
